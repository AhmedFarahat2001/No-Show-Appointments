# Introduction
This dataset collects information from 100k medical appointments in Brazil and is focused on the question of whether or not patients show up for their appointment. A number of
characteristics about the patient are included in each row.

● ‘ScheduledDay’ tells us on
what day the patient set up their
appointment.

● ‘Neighborhood’ indicates the
location of the hospital.

● ‘Scholarship’ indicates
whether or not the patient is
enrolled in Brasilian welfare
program Bolsa Família.

● Be careful about the encoding
of the last column: it says ‘No’ if
the patient showed up to their
appointment, and ‘Yes’ if they
did not show up.
